<h1 align="center">Windows Server 2016 Disappears From Network List</h1>
	<p align="center">May 23, 2017</p>
		<p>Yesterday I found all computers on company network couldnâ€™t see the server. All the computers are running windows 10, and the server is installed MS Server 2016 standard edition. All computers were able to see the server before yesterday.

	<p>Each computers and server could ping each other without problem, which meant the network connection was good.

	<p>After several failed attempts to solve the problem, I fixed the problem using the following procedure.

	<p>Go to Services and scroll down to locate the service named Function Discovery Resource Publication service. I found that this service was not running. After I  started it, the server appeared on the network list of file explorer for all computers.

	<p>The reason is that sometimes, the Function Discovery Resource Publication service might be stopped after windows updating. Maybe it is for the security consideration.
