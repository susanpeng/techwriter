<h1 align="center">How to Access My User Folder From The Terminal on Mac</h1>
	<p align="center">April 15, 2017</p>
		<p>When you enter the terminal, you are normally under your home directory. If you are in a different folder for some other reasons (for example you switched folder around), you can just do the following:

<p>cd $home</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>cd /users/your_username</p>

<p>(use the absolute path)</p>

<p>Then you will be back to your home folder.</p>

<p>Under your home folder, type:</p>

<p>pwd</p>

<p>You can see:</p>

<p>/Users/your_username</p>

<p>This makes sure that you are in the right directory and path.</p>

<p>When you type:</p>

<p>cd..</p>

<p>You will be under Users folder again.</p>
<p>The reason for me to write above paragraph</p>

<p>If you type:</p>

<p>cd /</p>

<p>ls</p>

<p>You don’t see Users directory by default (ls –la will do).</p>
