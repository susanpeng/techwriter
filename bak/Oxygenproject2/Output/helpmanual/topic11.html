            <p>To implement single-source publishing, the content management team needs to take the
                following actions:</p>
            <ul><li>Select tools<p>There are many applications on the market, and each one has
                        special features in addition to the basic functions of single-sourcing
                        publishing applications. Select the tool that is suitable to the practical
                        situation of your organization. If it is necessary, consult the
                        single-source publishing specialist for help. </p></li><li>Design workflow to adapt to the single-source publishing system<p>Implementation
                        of single-source publishing involves more than a change of software tools
                        for content production. It is a totally new concept of content management.
                        To maximize the benefits from single-source publishing, the workflow should
                        be different from that suitable for traditional content management methods.
                        The whole workflow needs to be re-designed, so that the single-source
                        publishing system can really benefit the organization.</p></li><li>Educate content writers<p>Train content writers. It is very important for
                        content writers to learn how to use single-source publishing tools to author
                        content. The single-source publishing system will be successful only if
                        content writers can use the authoring tools properly.</p></li><li>Convert existing documents<p>If the organization has existing documents in an
                        unstructured format, these documents must be converted to structured
                        document in XML format. Some single-source publishing applications come with
                        modules that can convert legacy contents to the format that can be used in
                        new system. Management teams should consider this factor when selecting
                        single-source publishing tools. </p></li></ul>
