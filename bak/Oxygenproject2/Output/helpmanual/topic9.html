The concerns when shifting to single-source publishing</div><h2>3.6. The concerns when shifting to single-source publishing</h2><div class="topiccontent">
                <p>To shift to a single-source publishing system from a traditional content
                    management system, there are two issues that need to be considered:</p>
                <p><b>Convert the legacy documents</b></p>
                <p>Single-source publishing is not only a strategy but also a concept. Its core idea
                    is automation, letting software do the work of formatting content. Because we
                    use software applications to work on formatting, we need to prepare the content
                    in a different way from a traditional content authoring system.</p>
                <p>In a single-source publishing system, the contents have to be divided into small
                    sections called topics. For each topic, there is described message or metadata
                    about it. The metadata will be used to transform topics to different desired
                    formats.</p>
                <p>Some organizations have legacy source content existing in different formats most
                    likely in Microsoft Word, and being saved in big chunks, or as unstructured
                    documents. Some single-source publishing applications have modules to help users
                    convert legacy unstructured documents to structured documents in XML format. The
                    content management team of the organization needs to be concerned with
                    converting legacy documents when they shift to a single-source publishing system
                    from a traditional content management system.</p>
                <p><b>Standardize and simplify output format</b></p>
                <p>In a traditional content management system, the contents are saved and processed
                    separately for different publishing media. These documents usually are manually
                    formatted in a very unique or even creative style. But in a single-source
                    publishing system, the output format should be kept standard and simple,
                    otherwise the complexity of the transformation software will outweigh the
                    convenience of using the single-source publishing application. </p>
                <p>In order to maximize the benefits of using single-source publishing, it is
                    necessary to standardize and simplify the output format, and less output
                    diversity is preferred. </p>
