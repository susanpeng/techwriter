Conclusions</div><h2>11.5. Conclusions</h2><div class="topiccontent">
				<p>The usability testing confirmed that the user's manual is a valuable tool for completing tasks in Bookshelf Editor 1.1. All of the tester's comments were relatively consistent concerning the quality and usefulness of the user's manual. All were confused by the term "breadcrumbs" and they had difficulty navigating the manual when only using the table of contents. Otherwise, aside from a couple small sections that will be renamed, all testers found the instructions in the user's manual to be very helpful for completing the tasks and for learning the product. They also felt that the manual was organized in a logical manner, and it contained straight-forward figures with clear descriptions.</p>
