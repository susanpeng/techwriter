Why single-source publishing</div><h2>3.1. Why single-source publishing</h2><div class="topiccontent">
                <p>As technology progresses, more and more different media formats have been
                    emerging. Besides traditional print materials, there are the PDF format used for
                    reading on the computer, the HTML format used as online searchable content, and
                    the Word format that is easy to read and edit. Even for the same online content,
                    different formats need to be considered to deliver the most comfortable
                    readability for readers because of the different screen sizes for a desktop
                    computer, a tablet, or a smart phone.</p>
                <p>In a traditional document management system, the most likely situation might be
                    this: there is one source file for each publishing media format. For example,
                    online help is saved as an html file with Dreamweaver, and the source file for a
                    PDF version is saved as an MS word format. There might also be an InDesign
                    version for paper print. All of these files need to be modified separately when
                    the product that the documents describe is updated.</p>
                <div class="figure"><img src="Images/../images/cont-manag-old-small.png" alt="" /><div class="figtitle"><b>Fig. 1. Traditional content management system (Stagnaro)</b></div></div>
                <p>Obviously, there is much repeatitive work in authoring, editing, and formatting
                    the source contents for each media format. Because of the rapid development of
                    technology, most products are updated more and more frequently unless they are
                    not being used anymore. That leads to the need for frequent changes in the
                    documents that describe the product. Under this circumstance, the editing and
                    formatting for the multiple versions of the same content will be a significant
                    waste of employee time and money.</p>
                <p>While globalization is getting more and more popular, translation becomes a huge
                    workload. If multiple versions of the same content need to be translated, the
                    expense is significantly more than that of translating only one version of the
                    same content.</p>
                <p>Finally, when all the different formats of the documents are manually processed,
                    not only will the workload will be extremely heavy, but here will be more
                    chances for human error. The quality of the content will be compromised, and the
                    delivery time can't be guaranteed. </p>
                <p>Because of the issues mentioned above, it is obviously necessary to introduce a
                    content publishing system that can minimize workloads, improve publishing
                    quality, deliver content in a timely manner, and reduce overall costs,
                    especially those of humanpower.</p>
