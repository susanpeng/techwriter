         <p>Dear classmates</p>
         
         <p class="subject"><b>Subject: </b>Manual Writing Assignments
         </p>
         
         <div class="letter">
            
            <p>Please consider me as your group partner for the manual writing assignments (assignments
               #3 and #4). You will certainly benefit from my contribution to the project because
               I have a strong software development background and excellent teamwork skills.
            </p>
            
            <p>I have a master's degree in Electrical Engineering. The strict training required for
               my degree has made me into a person with a logical way of thinking, strong analytical
               ability, and problem solving skills.
            </p>
            
            <p>I have over 10 years of experience working in the IT field. In the past years, I have
               developed many applications; therefore I can quickly understand how software works.
               This
               understanding is very important for writing manuals. In the course of my work, I have
               both read and written many instructions, user guides and manuals, so I am able to
               tell
               what kind of manual or instructions are easily understood.
            </p>
            
            <p>I have hands-on working experience with XML, website administration and development,
               graphics design (Adobe Flash, Photoshop), etc. All of those experiences will help
               to make the work on manual assignments easy for our group.
            </p>
            
            <p>I strongly believe that behind any successful project there is a great team, so I
               always
               pay close attention to collaborating with co-workers. I am happy to help people and
               to
               share my opinions, and am also open to new technology and suggestions from others.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>The above points should convince you that working with me will be a pleasant and creative
               experience. Let's work as a team to fulfill our assignments with a high standard.
            </p>
            
            <p>Please contact me by email: pengyl@gmail.com to discuss the formation of an enthusiastic
               team. I look forward to working with you to produce a very excellent and successful
               project.
            </p>
