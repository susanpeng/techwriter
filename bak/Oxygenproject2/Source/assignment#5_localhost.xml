        <body>
            <p>Single-source publishing is a content production-and-publishing system that promises
                authoring once and publishing anywhere. It enables organizations to deliver quality
                content in a timely manner and at much lower cost compared to the traditional
                content management method. </p>
            <p>In the traditional content management system, several versions of the same content
                are most likely created and edited for different publishing media. This causes
                content redundancy. When any changes to the content are required because of the
                product updating, the modifications need to be applied to all versions of same
                content. This wastes human energy and money, extends the production delivery cycle,
                and increases the chances of having errors caused by manual formatting. </p>
            <p>Single-source publishing divides the content production into two phases: authoring
                and publishing. For the authoring phase, content is separated into small parts
                called topics, and only one version is stored for the content no matter what the
                publishing media are. For the publishing phase, the system uses transformation
                modules to convert the structured contents to the desired formats based on the
                publishing medium.</p>
            <p>Single-source publishing greatly reduces the workload; therefore, it will reduce
                cost, shorten production cycles, and improve content quality. </p>
            <p>To implement single-source publishing, single-source application tools are required.
                Several popular tools are introduced in this report. The workflow needs to be
                rearranged to suit the single-source publishing procedure. Also the writers need to
                learn how to use single-source publishing tools for content authoring and
                publishing.</p>
            <p>The tradeoff of using single-source publishing is the lack of diversity in output
                format. "The essence of single-source publishing is the automation of publishing
                processes. The more you can standardize and simplify your published outputs, the
                greater will be the benefits of single-source publishing" (Meyer).</p>
            <p>Single-source publishing is an effective and efficient content management method,
                which is used more and more widely in the content authoring, editing, and publishing
                process. The main steps for implementing single-source publishing are explained
                under <xref id="recommendations">Recommendations</xref>.</p>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <body>
            <p>Nowadays, many medium formats are required for publishing content such as user's
                manual, user guidelines, release notes, etc. In the traditional content processing
                procedure, the documents for different publishing media usually are processed
                separately. All of those files need to be modified separately when the product that
                the documents describe is updated. An organization that keeps one source file for
                each different publishing medium needs to maintain multiple versions of the same
                content. This causes much redundant work in authoring, editing and formatting
                processing, and at the same time it is not easy for a content management team to
                track the changes for different versions.</p>
            <p>For this reason, more and more professionals have started to work on how to use a
                single-source publishing method to save time and money. In this method, only one
                version of content is created and maintained allowing production of several
                different media formats from the same original content.</p>
            <p>Single-source publishing is a popular strategy for document and content management,
                which can reduce the cost of authoring, editing, and maintaining the technical
                content in terms of both human energy and money. â€œIt is clearly something we all
                need to consider as we attempt to offer cost effective, efficient, and highly
                impactful learning solutions for the organizations and learners we serve" (Moshe). </p>
            <p>Single-source publishing eliminates the redundant work, so an organization can
                publish content in a shorter period of time and at a lower cost. Maintaining only
                one source for the same content makes content management easier. Auto-formatting the
                output content delivers better quality content, because it avoids the errors caused
                by manual formatting. </p>
            <p>To maximize the benefits from single-source publishing, an organization needs to
                understand that single-source publishing involves not only a change in editing
                software, but also a new concept of content processing. So both management teams and
                writers need to learn how to work to adapt to the single-source publishing system. </p>
            <p>Several widely used single-source publishing applications are introduced in this
                report. An organization can select the suitable application based on its own needs
                and situation. </p>
            <p>The tradeoff for single-source publishing is less output format diversity. Since the
                main idea of single-source publishing is automation, it is very important to
                standardize and simplify the output format.</p>

            <title>Why single-source publishing</title>
            <body>
                <p>As technology progresses, more and more different media formats have been
                    emerging. Besides traditional print materials, there are the PDF format used for
                    reading on the computer, the HTML format used as online searchable content, and
                    the Word format that is easy to read and edit. Even for the same online content,
                    different formats need to be considered to deliver the most comfortable
                    readability for readers because of the different screen sizes for a desktop
                    computer, a tablet, or a smart phone.</p>
                <p>In a traditional document management system, the most likely situation might be
                    this: there is one source file for each publishing media format. For example,
                    online help is saved as an html file with Dreamweaver, and the source file for a
                    PDF version is saved as an MS word format. There might also be an InDesign
                    version for paper print. All of these files need to be modified separately when
                    the product that the documents describe is updated.</p>
                <fig>
                    <figtitle>Fig. 1. Traditional content management system (Stagnaro)</figtitle>
                    <image href="../images/cont-manag-old-small.png" alt=""/>
                </fig>
                <p>Obviously, there is much repeatitive work in authoring, editing, and formatting
                    the source contents for each media format. Because of the rapid development of
                    technology, most products are updated more and more frequently unless they are
                    not being used anymore. That leads to the need for frequent changes in the
                    documents that describe the product. Under this circumstance, the editing and
                    formatting for the multiple versions of the same content will be a significant
                    waste of employee time and money.</p>
                <p>While globalization is getting more and more popular, translation becomes a huge
                    workload. If multiple versions of the same content need to be translated, the
                    expense is significantly more than that of translating only one version of the
                    same content.</p>
                <p>Finally, when all the different formats of the documents are manually processed,
                    not only will the workload will be extremely heavy, but here will be more
                    chances for human error. The quality of the content will be compromised, and the
                    delivery time can't be guaranteed. </p>
                <p>Because of the issues mentioned above, it is obviously necessary to introduce a
                    content publishing system that can minimize workloads, improve publishing
                    quality, deliver content in a timely manner, and reduce overall costs,
                    especially those of humanpower.</p>

            <title>What is single-source publishing</title>
            <body>
                <p>Single-source publishing is a process that organizes technical contents in one
                    place and publishes the content into different media or formats from the same
                    original source. Single-source publishing can reduce the cost of human energy
                    and money for authoring, editing, maintaining, and publishing content. With the
                    rapid development of technology, the product update cycle becomes shorter and
                    shorter; therefore, it is becoming more and more important to deliver updated
                    documents in a timely manner, with exceptional quality, and at a reasonable
                    cost. </p>
                <p>Single-source publishing system divides the content publishing processes into two
                    phases: the first phase is authoring, and the second phase is publishing. </p>
                <p><b>Authoring</b></p>
                <p>First, all the content is organized in only one place without duplicated
                    versions, so that only one content source needs to be modified when the product
                    it describes is updated. Repeated works are avoided, because no duplicated
                    version in any other place needs to be modified. Especially when translation is
                    required due to globalization needs, an organization will greatly reduce
                    translation expenses for duplicated versions of source content. </p>
                
                <p>Second, all contents are organized in a structured manner; that is, a big trunk
                    document is divided into many small parts called topics. For each topic, there
                    is a group of data called metadata to describe the features of the topic. This
                    structure makes it possible for the transformation modules to convert the
                    content to the format of the publishing medium.</p>
                <fig>
                    <figtitle>Fig. 2. Single-source publishing system ("An Overview of MadCap
                        Flare")</figtitle>
                    <image href="../images/cont-manag-new-small.png" alt=""/>
                </fig>
                <p><b>Publishing</b></p>
                <p>Transformation modules are designed to conduct the formatting work automatically.
                    A specific transformation module is designed for each publishing output format,
                    so one can get the desired format for one publishing medium by selecting the
                    right transformation module. Auto-formatting makes the whole publishing process
                    faster, delivers consistent layout of published content, and eliminates the
                    errors caused by manual formatting.</p>
                <p><b>XML and single-source publishing</b></p>
                <p>One of the essential features of single-source publishing is that it separates
                    content structure from appearance; this is implemented by using an XML-based
                    documentation system. </p>
                <p>An XML file uses tags to define content structure. All contents in XML are
                    wrapped in tags. A DTD file defines the tags that are valid to be used in an XML
                    file and contains the rules about how to use the tags. An XSLT file is used to
                    transform XML tags to XHTML tags, so the content of the XML source file can be
                    displayed in a browser. XSLT makes it possible for the same source XML file to
                    be displayed in a different format by adding, removing and changing the content
                    of XML file. An XSL-FO file is also a stylesheet, which is used most frequently
                    to transform an XML source file to a PDF document.</p>

            <title>The benefits of single-source publishing</title>
            <body>
                <p>Overall single-source publishing can benefit an organization in the following
                    ways:</p>
                <p><b>Reduce the workload tremendously</b></p>
                <p>In a traditional content management system, usually more than one source exists
                    for the same content due to different publishing media. For all the different
                    versions of the content, authoring, editing, and formatting are likely conducted
                    separately. In a single-source publishing system, however, the workflow is
                    clearly divided into two phases: authoring and publishing. In the authoring
                    phase, the contents are organized as structured documents made of many topics.
                    In the publishing phase, transformation modules can convert the content to the
                    desired format. </p>
                <p>Obviously maintaining only one version of the same content greatly reduces the
                    workload compared to that of maintaining several different versions. The
                    auto-formatting function of the transformation modules in a single-source
                    publishing system completely replaces the manual formatting work in a
                    traditional content management system.</p>
                <p><b>Save human resources and money</b></p>
                <p>Maintaining only one source for each part of the content and auto-formatting
                    reduces workload significantly; therefore, the savings of human resources and
                    money will be considerable.</p>
                <p><b>Deliver product in a timely manner</b></p>
                <p>The automation of converting the source content to different desired formats
                    shortens the production time, so that the final published product can be
                    delivered to users much faster than using a traditional content management
                    system.</p>
                <p><b>Eliminate errors caused by manually re-formatting</b></p>
                <p>Because auto-formatting modules replace manual formatting in the single-source
                    publishing system, human errors will be avoided. </p>
                <p><b>Make content management easier</b></p>
                <p>The contents are saved in only one source, so it is easy to keep track of the
                    contents when modification is required because of product updates.</p>
                <p><b>Increase the efficiency of an organization</b>
                </p>
                <p>When an organization can deliver quality product in a timely manner, it will
                    attract more customers and most likely make more sales. The reduced publishing
                    costs make the organization financially robust. All of these increase the
                    organization's competency in the competitive market.</p>

            <title>How to implement single-source publishing</title>
            <body>
                <p>The management team needs to realize that single-source publishing is not "just a
                    change in file format like moving from one office application to another"
                    (Meyer) and that the main goals are "to replace redundant, manual tasks with
                    automated processes wherever possible and to improve the accuracy and
                    consistency of published documents" (Meyer).</p>
                <p>Although single-source publishing depends on a software application for
                    implementation, the people who are involved in the process are even more
                    important. </p>
                <p>To implement single-source publishing, the work that needs to be done can be
                    divided into the following categories: </p>
                <p><b>Funding</b> Funding is essential. Senior management members need to realize
                    the importance and necessity of single-source publishing, so that they will
                    approve the funding for implementing single-source publishing. The funding
                    should cover the costs of software, of training, and the cost for converting
                    some current content to the format required by single-source publishing.</p>
                <p><b>Content management team</b> The content management team should understand that
                    single-source publishing involves not only a change of content authoring tools,
                    but also a totally different manner of working. They need to re-arrange workflow
                    and re-allocate the human resources to adapt to the new working processes. They
                    also need to consider how to convert legacy contents and train writers.</p>
                <p><b>Content writers</b> Content writers need to recognize the advantages of
                    single-source publishing and be willing to learn how to use the single-source
                    publishing tools for authoring, editing, and publishing contents. If the project
                    is big enough, they also need to learn how to use version control software to
                    coordinate their work. Usually specific training is required for this.</p>
                <p><b>Software application</b>A single-source publishing application needs to be
                    selected. Software applications play a very important role in single-source
                    publishing systems, because automation is the core concept for the system. The
                    management team needs to consider the practical situation and the different
                    features of software applications to decide which application to use. If
                    necessary, specialist consultants should be invited to help to make the
                    decision. </p>

                <title>Tools for single-source publishing</title>
                <body>
                    <p>Software applications are necessary to implement single-source publishing.
                    The software application consists of mainly two parts: authoring and
                    transformation (formatting), correspondent with the two phases of single-source
                    publishing processes, authoring and publishing.</p>
                    <p>The authoring part creates the content as structured documents; the
                    transformation part consists of converting modules for different medium formats.
                    All single-source publishing applications have these two basic parts, even
                    though each application has its own additional features.</p>
                <p>The following are some single-source publishing applications on the market.</p>
                <p><b>Adobe FrameMaker</b> is a powerful software application for authoring,
                    enriching, managing, and publishing XML/DITA and unstructured content. Like
                    other software applications from Adobe, it is good quality software and
                    convenient to use. It supports multiple channels, formats, and screens, and it
                    can be used for both structured content and unstructured content. Its strength
                    is that it can strongly support rich multimedia such as audio, video, and 3-D. </p>
                <p><b>MadCap Flare</b> is an application used to create user guides, online help
                    systems, knowledge bases, eBooks, and manuals, etc. It organizes the content
                    into topics and supports topic based authoring. It can convert existing content
                    from word format to topic based contents, and this is a very useful feature for
                    organizations that plan to use a single-source publishing system and have lots
                    of legacy unstructured content that needs to be converted.</p>
                <p><b>Author-it</b> is a Saas (software as a service) and Cloud based single-source
                    publishing application. It includes a feature-rich editor, component CMS (using
                    MS SQL Server), multi channel publishing, and translation management. Author-it
                    uses a template that can be modified to control the format of output content.
                    Its output includes PDF, PowerPoint, online shtml, web CMSs, DITA, and Adobe
                    formats. The Saas and Cloud features let users access the application from
                    anywhere a browser and Internet connection is available at a lower upfront
                    cost.</p>
                <p><b>XMLSpy</b> is a single-source publishing application. The authoring part let
                    users author content into an XML file that consists of many small topics. The
                    transformation part has different converting modules that users can select
                    according to their needs. After selecting desired converting module, users can
                    run the transformation function to get a publishing result with the desired
                    format. All formats are converted automatically without human interference.</p>

            <title>The concerns when shifting to single-source publishing</title>
            <body>
                <p>To shift to a single-source publishing system from a traditional content
                    management system, there are two issues that need to be considered:</p>
                <p><b>Convert the legacy documents</b></p>
                <p>Single-source publishing is not only a strategy but also a concept. Its core idea
                    is automation, letting software do the work of formatting content. Because we
                    use software applications to work on formatting, we need to prepare the content
                    in a different way from a traditional content authoring system.</p>
                <p>In a single-source publishing system, the contents have to be divided into small
                    sections called topics. For each topic, there is described message or metadata
                    about it. The metadata will be used to transform topics to different desired
                    formats.</p>
                <p>Some organizations have legacy source content existing in different formats most
                    likely in Microsoft Word, and being saved in big chunks, or as unstructured
                    documents. Some single-source publishing applications have modules to help users
                    convert legacy unstructured documents to structured documents in XML format. The
                    content management team of the organization needs to be concerned with
                    converting legacy documents when they shift to a single-source publishing system
                    from a traditional content management system.</p>
                <p><b>Standardize and simplify output format</b></p>
                <p>In a traditional content management system, the contents are saved and processed
                    separately for different publishing media. These documents usually are manually
                    formatted in a very unique or even creative style. But in a single-source
                    publishing system, the output format should be kept standard and simple,
                    otherwise the complexity of the transformation software will outweigh the
                    convenience of using the single-source publishing application. </p>
                <p>In order to maximize the benefits of using single-source publishing, it is
                    necessary to standardize and simplify the output format, and less output
                    diversity is preferred. </p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <body>
            <p>Single-source publishing is an effective and efficient content management method,
                which is used more and more widely in the content authoring, editing, maintaining,
                and publishing process.</p>
            <p>When single-source publishing is used in an organization, the documentation can be
                easily converted into the desired media format according to the users' requirements.
                This method can deliver the new or updated content with better quality and in a
                timely manner. At the same time this method saves huge amounts of repeated works
                compared to what is required when single-source publishing is not used, therefore,
                it reduces the costs for the organization. All of these advantages will increase the
                competency of the organization.</p>
            <p>To use the single sourcing publishing method, a single-source publishing software
                application is required. Technical writers need to learn how to use the application
                to author. Most importantly the content management team should understand that they
                need to re-design a new workflow to suit the single-source publishing system.</p>
            <p>Several commonly used single-source publishing tools are introduced in this report.
                Organizations might need to consult with single-source publishing specialists to
                select the proper tools according to their practical situations.</p>
            <p>A single-source publishing system can help to cut project time, increase
                productivity, reduce localization costs, streamline content delivery, and improve
                the quality and consistency of publishing content. For a technical writer both
                understanding single-source publishing and learning related technology are very
                important.</p>

        <title>Recommendations</title>
        <body>
            <p>To implement single-source publishing, the content management team needs to take the
                following actions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Select tools<p>There are many applications on the market, and each one has
                        special features in addition to the basic functions of single-sourcing
                        publishing applications. Select the tool that is suitable to the practical
                        situation of your organization. If it is necessary, consult the
                        single-source publishing specialist for help. </p></li>
                <li>Design workflow to adapt to the single-source publishing system<p>Implementation
                        of single-source publishing involves more than a change of software tools
                        for content production. It is a totally new concept of content management.
                        To maximize the benefits from single-source publishing, the workflow should
                        be different from that suitable for traditional content management methods.
                        The whole workflow needs to be re-designed, so that the single-source
                        publishing system can really benefit the organization.</p></li>
                <li>Educate content writers<p>Train content writers. It is very important for
                        content writers to learn how to use single-source publishing tools to author
                        content. The single-source publishing system will be successful only if
                        content writers can use the authoring tools properly.</p></li>
                <li>Convert existing documents<p>If the organization has existing documents in an
                        unstructured format, these documents must be converted to structured
                        document in XML format. Some single-source publishing applications come with
                        modules that can convert legacy contents to the format that can be used in
                        new system. Management teams should consider this factor when selecting
                        single-source publishing tools. </p></li>
