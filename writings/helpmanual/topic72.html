					<p>Hi [the participant's name]</p>
					<p>Thank you for agreeing to participate in testing.</p>
					<p>I'm [the tester's name] and I will be working with you today, monitoring this session, and taking notes.</p>
					<p>The purpose of this test is to determine how useful the Bookshelf Editor manual is for accomplishing typical tasks in the Bookshelf Editor application. Please do not be concerned with achieving results. We are not testing you. You are here to provide us with initial feedback on the manual and to help us detect any problems or errors we may have missed.</p>
					<p>Before the beginning of the test, I will provide you with a sheet with a list of tasks to complete in Bookshelf Editor. During the session, you will work through each task, and I will observe you and take some notes. Please note that you are testing the manual, not the software . Please refer to the Bookshelf Editor manual for information on how to complete each task. Also, please consult the manual first if you have any questions related to the software functionality or user interface.</p>
					<p>You can ask any question any time, but I may not answer them since we will be testing the usability of the documentation. I would like to encourage you to think out loud as you work through the tasks.</p>
					<p>After you complete each task, Iâ€™ll ask you to rate how useful the manual was for helping you to perform the task. I will use a 6-point evaluation scale for each task in a list. After you finish the test, I'll ask you a few questions regarding you experience using the manual. You are free to leave at any point during the testing process if you want to.</p>
					<p>Do you have any question before we begin?
                </p>
