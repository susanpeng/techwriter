Results</div><h2>11.4. Results</h2><div class="topiccontent">
				<p>The usability testing results showed little variance for all three of the subjects who "volunteered" to assist in the evaluation of the Bookshelf Editor manual. The majority of the relatively few complaints were due to issues relating to the usability testing questions versus the content of the user manual.</p>
				<p>The complaints about the user manual content were minor and focused around word choice and the location of a couple sections. Other complaints about the user manual focused on the presentation method of HTML and the navigational features available in the table of contents. All testers preferred to use the index version of the HTML, which includes the table of contents in a sidebar next to the manual contents.</p>
				<p>All testers were confused by the term "breadcrumbs", which is listed in the "using this manual" section.  Other things that hindered completion of the tasks included the sections involving viewing properties and viewing the HTML code. The sections that included information on saving the bookshelf and on opening the HTML version of the exported bookshelf needed more detail to suggest to the more modestly-skilled users where to locate their files.</p>
