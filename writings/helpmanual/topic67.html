Methodology</div><h2>11.3. Methodology</h2><div class="topiccontent">
				<p>There are several goals for usability testing:</p>
				<ul><li>Find people willing to test the software user's manual who are computer literate, but have never seen the software before (participants).</li><li>Provide the participants with the same set of tasks to complete in the Bookshelf Editor, using the manual to accomplish each task.</li><li>Provide each participant with a consistent testing environment, including how the test is introduced and conducted.</li><li>Ask each participant the same questions upon completion of each task and at the end of each session.</li><li>Compile the test results to determine the quality and the usefulness of the manual as it currently exists.</li><li>Modify the manual as needed to improve usability.</li></ul>
				<p> The test involved adult participants with no previous exposure to Bookshelf Editor 1.1. The test was conducted as a series of one-on-one sessions with live interactions between a tester and a participant according to the test plan. During the test, a tester made careful observations of a participant’s interaction with Bookshelf Editor and user's manual and recorded the participant’s questions, requests, and comments. A tester also solicited clarification on participant issues and remarks. When a participant couldn’t find information in the manual or complete a task, a tester provided a hint. Once a participant completed all test tasks, a tester conducted an interview following the post-test questionnaires.</p>
				<p>With the participants gone, the testers formalized the notes they took during the testing.</p>
				<p>With the testing completed, the testing group held a series of post-test discussions considering the study findings and analyzing the usability problem areas. Based on the test results, the testing group provided the recommendations for correcting the defects and common usability issues. The testing group implemented the suggested modifications to the Bookshelf Editor Help manual. The final version of the help manual incorporates the changes recommended in the test report and the changes that address the course instructor’s comments.</p>
