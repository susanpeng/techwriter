Introduction</h2><div class="topiccontent">
            <p>Nowadays, many medium formats are required for publishing content such as user's
                manual, user guidelines, release notes, etc. In the traditional content processing
                procedure, the documents for different publishing media usually are processed
                separately. All of those files need to be modified separately when the product that
                the documents describe is updated. An organization that keeps one source file for
                each different publishing medium needs to maintain multiple versions of the same
                content. This causes much redundant work in authoring, editing and formatting
                processing, and at the same time it is not easy for a content management team to
                track the changes for different versions.</p>
            <p>For this reason, more and more professionals have started to work on how to use a
                single-source publishing method to save time and money. In this method, only one
                version of content is created and maintained allowing production of several
                different media formats from the same original content.</p>
            <p>Single-source publishing is a popular strategy for document and content management,
                which can reduce the cost of authoring, editing, and maintaining the technical
                content in terms of both human energy and money. â€œIt is clearly something we all
                need to consider as we attempt to offer cost effective, efficient, and highly
                impactful learning solutions for the organizations and learners we serve" (Moshe). </p>
            <p>Single-source publishing eliminates the redundant work, so an organization can
                publish content in a shorter period of time and at a lower cost. Maintaining only
                one source for the same content makes content management easier. Auto-formatting the
                output content delivers better quality content, because it avoids the errors caused
                by manual formatting. </p>
            <p>To maximize the benefits from single-source publishing, an organization needs to
                understand that single-source publishing involves not only a change in editing
                software, but also a new concept of content processing. So both management teams and
                writers need to learn how to work to adapt to the single-source publishing system. </p>
            <p>Several widely used single-source publishing applications are introduced in this
                report. An organization can select the suitable application based on its own needs
                and situation. </p>
            <p>The tradeoff for single-source publishing is less output format diversity. Since the
                main idea of single-source publishing is automation, it is very important to
                standardize and simplify the output format.</p>
