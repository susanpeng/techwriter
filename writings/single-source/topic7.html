How to implement single-source publishing</div><h2>3.4. How to implement single-source publishing</h2><div class="topiccontent">
                <p>The management team needs to realize that single-source publishing is not "just a
                    change in file format like moving from one office application to another"
                    (Meyer) and that the main goals are "to replace redundant, manual tasks with
                    automated processes wherever possible and to improve the accuracy and
                    consistency of published documents" (Meyer).</p>
                <p>Although single-source publishing depends on a software application for
                    implementation, the people who are involved in the process are even more
                    important. </p>
                <p>To implement single-source publishing, the work that needs to be done can be
                    divided into the following categories: </p>
                <p><b>Funding</b> Funding is essential. Senior management members need to realize
                    the importance and necessity of single-source publishing, so that they will
                    approve the funding for implementing single-source publishing. The funding
                    should cover the costs of software, of training, and the cost for converting
                    some current content to the format required by single-source publishing.</p>
                <p><b>Content management team</b> The content management team should understand that
                    single-source publishing involves not only a change of content authoring tools,
                    but also a totally different manner of working. They need to re-arrange workflow
                    and re-allocate the human resources to adapt to the new working processes. They
                    also need to consider how to convert legacy contents and train writers.</p>
                <p><b>Content writers</b> Content writers need to recognize the advantages of
                    single-source publishing and be willing to learn how to use the single-source
                    publishing tools for authoring, editing, and publishing contents. If the project
                    is big enough, they also need to learn how to use version control software to
                    coordinate their work. Usually specific training is required for this.</p>
                <p><b>Software application</b>A single-source publishing application needs to be
                    selected. Software applications play a very important role in single-source
                    publishing systems, because automation is the core concept for the system. The
                    management team needs to consider the practical situation and the different
                    features of software applications to decide which application to use. If
                    necessary, specialist consultants should be invited to help to make the
                    decision. </p>
