The benefits of single-source publishing</div><h2>3.3. The benefits of single-source publishing</h2><div class="topiccontent">
                <p>Overall single-source publishing can benefit an organization in the following
                    ways:</p>
                <p><b>Reduce the workload tremendously</b></p>
                <p>In a traditional content management system, usually more than one source exists
                    for the same content due to different publishing media. For all the different
                    versions of the content, authoring, editing, and formatting are likely conducted
                    separately. In a single-source publishing system, however, the workflow is
                    clearly divided into two phases: authoring and publishing. In the authoring
                    phase, the contents are organized as structured documents made of many topics.
                    In the publishing phase, transformation modules can convert the content to the
                    desired format. </p>
                <p>Obviously maintaining only one version of the same content greatly reduces the
                    workload compared to that of maintaining several different versions. The
                    auto-formatting function of the transformation modules in a single-source
                    publishing system completely replaces the manual formatting work in a
                    traditional content management system.</p>
                <p><b>Save human resources and money</b></p>
                <p>Maintaining only one source for each part of the content and auto-formatting
                    reduces workload significantly; therefore, the savings of human resources and
                    money will be considerable.</p>
                <p><b>Deliver product in a timely manner</b></p>
                <p>The automation of converting the source content to different desired formats
                    shortens the production time, so that the final published product can be
                    delivered to users much faster than using a traditional content management
                    system.</p>
                <p><b>Eliminate errors caused by manually re-formatting</b></p>
                <p>Because auto-formatting modules replace manual formatting in the single-source
                    publishing system, human errors will be avoided. </p>
                <p><b>Make content management easier</b></p>
                <p>The contents are saved in only one source, so it is easy to keep track of the
                    contents when modification is required because of product updates.</p>
                <p><b>Increase the efficiency of an organization</b>
                </p>
                <p>When an organization can deliver quality product in a timely manner, it will
                    attract more customers and most likely make more sales. The reduced publishing
                    costs make the organization financially robust. All of these increase the
                    organization's competency in the competitive market.</p>
