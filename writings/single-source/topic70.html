Recommendations</div><h2>11.6. Recommendations</h2><div class="topiccontent">
				<p>Based on the positive reviews of the documentation content from the test subjects there are not many changes required to improve the quality and usability of the userâ€™s manual. The largest improvement to the user manual would be to make it available as a PDF. PDFs offer a better format for searching and scrolling through the manual. Another option would be for the HTML to include a numbering for the sections and sub-sections in the table of contents.</p>
				<p>Changes to improve the content of the manual include renaming the Narrow (Default) book to "narrow (default) book", reworking the awkwardly worded sentences like "Select the book to which you want to apply a color change" and adding missing terms to the index (that is, HTML, title, and exporting). "Breadcrumbs" should be added to the glossary and the description updated in the <b>How to use this manual section</b>.  <b>Section 8.2 Exporting to HTML</b> can also be improved by adding a step to clarify the context. The <b>ML Viewer</b> section should be re-labeled so that users understand that it is for viewing XML and HTML code. The section on saving the bookshelf should include directions that specify more explicitly where the files should be saved in order for the links to work and additional clarifications about save vs save as can be made as well. Likewise, the section on viewing HTML should have an example showing where the HTML file is most likely to be found. <b>Learning the Graphical User Interface (GUI)</b> and <b>Downloading and Installing the Bookshelf Editor</b> sections should change places. It may be a good idea to add steps to the <b>Starting Bookshelf Editor</b> section for users who elected not to install a desktop shortcut.</p>
