Tools for single-source publishing</div><h2>3.5. Tools for single-source publishing</h2><div class="topiccontent">
                    <p>Software applications are necessary to implement single-source publishing.
                    The software application consists of mainly two parts: authoring and
                    transformation (formatting), correspondent with the two phases of single-source
                    publishing processes, authoring and publishing.</p>
                    <p>The authoring part creates the content as structured documents; the
                    transformation part consists of converting modules for different medium formats.
                    All single-source publishing applications have these two basic parts, even
                    though each application has its own additional features.</p>
                <p>The following are some single-source publishing applications on the market.</p>
                <p><b>Adobe FrameMaker</b> is a powerful software application for authoring,
                    enriching, managing, and publishing XML/DITA and unstructured content. Like
                    other software applications from Adobe, it is good quality software and
                    convenient to use. It supports multiple channels, formats, and screens, and it
                    can be used for both structured content and unstructured content. Its strength
                    is that it can strongly support rich multimedia such as audio, video, and 3-D. </p>
                <p><b>MadCap Flare</b> is an application used to create user guides, online help
                    systems, knowledge bases, eBooks, and manuals, etc. It organizes the content
                    into topics and supports topic based authoring. It can convert existing content
                    from word format to topic based contents, and this is a very useful feature for
                    organizations that plan to use a single-source publishing system and have lots
                    of legacy unstructured content that needs to be converted.</p>
                <p><b>Author-it</b> is a Saas (software as a service) and Cloud based single-source
                    publishing application. It includes a feature-rich editor, component CMS (using
                    MS SQL Server), multi channel publishing, and translation management. Author-it
                    uses a template that can be modified to control the format of output content.
                    Its output includes PDF, PowerPoint, online shtml, web CMSs, DITA, and Adobe
                    formats. The Saas and Cloud features let users access the application from
                    anywhere a browser and Internet connection is available at a lower upfront
                    cost.</p>
                <p><b>XMLSpy</b> is a single-source publishing application. The authoring part let
                    users author content into an XML file that consists of many small topics. The
                    transformation part has different converting modules that users can select
                    according to their needs. After selecting desired converting module, users can
                    run the transformation function to get a publishing result with the desired
                    format. All formats are converted automatically without human interference.</p>
