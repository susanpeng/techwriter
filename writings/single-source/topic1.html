Executive Summary</h2><div class="topiccontent">
            <p>Single-source publishing is a content production-and-publishing system that promises
                authoring once and publishing anywhere. It enables organizations to deliver quality
                content in a timely manner and at much lower cost compared to the traditional
                content management method. </p>
            <p>In the traditional content management system, several versions of the same content
                are most likely created and edited for different publishing media. This causes
                content redundancy. When any changes to the content are required because of the
                product updating, the modifications need to be applied to all versions of same
                content. This wastes human energy and money, extends the production delivery cycle,
                and increases the chances of having errors caused by manual formatting. </p>
            <p>Single-source publishing divides the content production into two phases: authoring
                and publishing. For the authoring phase, content is separated into small parts
                called topics, and only one version is stored for the content no matter what the
                publishing media are. For the publishing phase, the system uses transformation
                modules to convert the structured contents to the desired formats based on the
                publishing medium.</p>
            <p>Single-source publishing greatly reduces the workload; therefore, it will reduce
                cost, shorten production cycles, and improve content quality. </p>
            <p>To implement single-source publishing, single-source application tools are required.
                Several popular tools are introduced in this report. The workflow needs to be
                rearranged to suit the single-source publishing procedure. Also the writers need to
                learn how to use single-source publishing tools for content authoring and
                publishing.</p>
            <p>The tradeoff of using single-source publishing is the lack of diversity in output
                format. "The essence of single-source publishing is the automation of publishing
                processes. The more you can standardize and simplify your published outputs, the
                greater will be the benefits of single-source publishing" (Meyer).</p>
            <p>Single-source publishing is an effective and efficient content management method,
                which is used more and more widely in the content authoring, editing, and publishing
                process. The main steps for implementing single-source publishing are explained
                under <a href="topic11.html">Recommendations</a>.</p>
