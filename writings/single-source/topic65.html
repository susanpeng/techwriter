Executive Summary</div><h2>11.1. Executive Summary</h2><div class="topiccontent">
				<p>The purpose of the usability test is to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the Bookshelf Editor manual for end users and to detect errors, defects, and issues in the content of the manual.  </p>
				<p>The testing group developed the orientation script, the list of tasks and the post-test questionnaires to assist the comprehensive study. The tasks and post testing questions include 6-point evaluation scale and a comment section for taking notes during testing. For the complete set of the test documents, refer to <a href="topic71.html">Appendix</a>.</p>
				<p>The feedback generated during the usability was all very positive, as it pertains to the user manual content and structure. Most of the criticisms were directed towards the navigational capabilities inherent in viewing a user manual in HTML format. There were a couple small changes to wording and section order that have been made to improve the manual even further, based on the participant feedback. The full list of changes is included in <a href="topic70.html">Recommendations</a>.</p>
				<p>We are confident that this user manual serves as an excellent reference for operating Bookshelf Editor 1.1.</p>
