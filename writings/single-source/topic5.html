What is single-source publishing</div><h2>3.2. What is single-source publishing</h2><div class="topiccontent">
                <p>Single-source publishing is a process that organizes technical contents in one
                    place and publishes the content into different media or formats from the same
                    original source. Single-source publishing can reduce the cost of human energy
                    and money for authoring, editing, maintaining, and publishing content. With the
                    rapid development of technology, the product update cycle becomes shorter and
                    shorter; therefore, it is becoming more and more important to deliver updated
                    documents in a timely manner, with exceptional quality, and at a reasonable
                    cost. </p>
                <p>Single-source publishing system divides the content publishing processes into two
                    phases: the first phase is authoring, and the second phase is publishing. </p>
                <p><b>Authoring</b></p>
                <p>First, all the content is organized in only one place without duplicated
                    versions, so that only one content source needs to be modified when the product
                    it describes is updated. Repeated works are avoided, because no duplicated
                    version in any other place needs to be modified. Especially when translation is
                    required due to globalization needs, an organization will greatly reduce
                    translation expenses for duplicated versions of source content. </p>
                
                <p>Second, all contents are organized in a structured manner; that is, a big trunk
                    document is divided into many small parts called topics. For each topic, there
                    is a group of data called metadata to describe the features of the topic. This
                    structure makes it possible for the transformation modules to convert the
                    content to the format of the publishing medium.</p>

                <p><b>Publishing</b></p>
                <p>Transformation modules are designed to conduct the formatting work automatically.
                    A specific transformation module is designed for each publishing output format,
                    so one can get the desired format for one publishing medium by selecting the
                    right transformation module. Auto-formatting makes the whole publishing process
                    faster, delivers consistent layout of published content, and eliminates the
                    errors caused by manual formatting.</p>
                <p><b>XML and single-source publishing</b></p>
                <p>One of the essential features of single-source publishing is that it separates
                    content structure from appearance; this is implemented by using an XML-based
                    documentation system. </p>
                <p>An XML file uses tags to define content structure. All contents in XML are
                    wrapped in tags. A DTD file defines the tags that are valid to be used in an XML
                    file and contains the rules about how to use the tags. An XSLT file is used to
                    transform XML tags to XHTML tags, so the content of the XML source file can be
                    displayed in a browser. XSLT makes it possible for the same source XML file to
                    be displayed in a different format by adding, removing and changing the content
                    of XML file. An XSL-FO file is also a stylesheet, which is used most frequently
                    to transform an XML source file to a PDF document.</p>
