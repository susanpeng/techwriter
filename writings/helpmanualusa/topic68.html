Results</div><h2>4. Results</h2><div class="topiccontent">
				<p>The usability testing results showed slight variance for all three of the subjects who "volunteered" to assist in  evaluating  the Bookshelf Editor User's Manual. The majority of issues  related to the usability testing questions versus the content of the user manual.</p>
	<p>The complaints about  User Manual content were minor and focused on word choice and the location of a couple of sections. Other complaints about the User's Manual focused on the presentation method of HTML and the navigational features available in the table of contents. All testers preferred to have         the table of contents in a sidebar next to the manual contents.</p>
				<p>All testers were confused by the term "breadcrumbs"    in the "How to use the manual" section. Other things that confused testers were in the              "Viewing properties and  the HTML code" section. The "Saving the bookshelf" and "Opening the exported bookshelf in HTML" section&nbsp;        needed more details for more modestly-skilled users to help them locate their files.</p>
