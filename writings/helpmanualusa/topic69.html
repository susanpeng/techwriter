Conclusions</div><h2>5. Conclusions</h2><div class="topiccontent">
				<p>The usability testing confirmed that the User's Manual is a valuable tool for completing tasks in Bookshelf Editor 1.1. All of the testers' comments were relatively consistent about the quality and usefulness of the User's Manual. All were confused by the term "breadcrumbs" and  had difficulty navigating the manual when only using the table of contents. They suggested changing names for a couple of small sections. All testers found the instructions in the user's manual    helpful for completing the tasks and  learning the product. They also felt that the manual was organized logically, and it contained precise figures with clear descriptions.</p>
