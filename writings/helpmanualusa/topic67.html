Methodology</div><h2>3. Methodology</h2><div class="topiccontent">
				<p>There are several goals for usability testing:</p>
				<ul><li>Find people willing to test the Bookshelf Editor User's manual. They should have different computer literacy but have never seen the software before participating in the test.</li>
			    <li>Provide the participants with the same set of tasks to complete in  Bookshelf Editor by using the Bookshelf Editor User's Manual.</li>
			    <li>Provide all participants with a consistent testing environment, including how the test is introduced and conducted.</li>
			    <li>Ask each participant the same questions upon completion of each task and at the end of each session.</li><li>Review  the test results to determine the manual's quality and  usefulness     as it currently exists.</li>
			    <li>Modify the User's Manual to improve usability if needed.</li>
				</ul>
				<p> The test involved adult participants with no previous exposure to Bookshelf Editor 1.1. According to the test plan, the test was conducted as a series of one-on-one sessions with live interactions between a tester and a participant. During the test, a tester  carefully observed  a participant’s interaction with Bookshelf Editor and the User's Manual,  recording the participant’s questions, requests, and comments. A tester also solicited clarification on participants' questions and remarks. When a participant couldn’t find information in the manual or complete a task, a tester provided a hint. Once a participant completed all test tasks, a tester interviewed the participant   following the post-test questionnaires.</p>
				<p>After the participant left, the testers formalized their notes taken during    testing.</p>
				<p>After   testing was completed, the testing group held a series of post-test discussions to   study findings and analyze usability problems. Based on test results, the testing group provided recommendations for correcting defects and common usability issues. Then, the testing group implemented the suggested modifications to the Bookshelf Editor User's Manual. The final version of the User's Manual incorporates the changes recommended in the test report.</p>
